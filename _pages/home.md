### About the Lab

<p>
WSSL's broad research interests are in the areas of AI-powered mobile/wearable computing and sustainable computing. Our research agenda has focused on <b>Sustainable Autonomous Things (SATs) </b> for the vision of the <b>Internet of Sustainable Medical Things, Internet of Sustainable Living Things</b>, and <b>Internet of Sustainable Flying Things</b>. Our work is interdisciplinary in nature, where we develop new techniques in sensor and sensing system development, algorithms, data analytics, signal processing, hardware, and firmware optimization to invent:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> (1) a new class of <b>medical devices</b> that can continuously and unobtrusively collect novel and important health data in non-clinical settings </li>
  <li> (2) a new class of <b>living sensors</b> that can live with plants/animals </li>
  <li> (3) a new class of <b>unmanned aerial vehicles</b> that requires extremely low maintenance. </li>
  <li> (4) We are also interested in <b>sustainable quantum computing</b>, and with Berkeley Lab, we have made some exciting progress. </li>
</ul>
